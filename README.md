# Project 2 Week - Portfolio Update 2

## Description

As like last time, I added projects that I had created during the weeks between Project 1 assignment and Project 2. These assignments include a ReadMe Generator, a Note Taker Application, an Employee Tracker intro to MySQL, an E-commerce app for Object Relational Mapping (ORM), as well as a Tech Blog demonstrating Model View Controllers (MVC).

To keep assignments separated for grading purposes, I created a new repo for adding the updated portfolio. Ultimately, I plan to transfer all my final works and what I have learned to my React app, though it is good to revisit some of the earlier works we studied with HTML and CSS.
